To generate an activation URL call this number from a smartphone: 888-571-2048
Follow prompts until it asks you if you are in front of the activation screen, say YES,
The the system will ask you if you would like to do it on a smartphone, say YES,
Wait for the activation link to be send via SMS, open that link in a browser on the phone then copy the URL and transfer it to a PC by sending an email to yourself/whatever other means.
At that point you can use it in Mac's IID_GET program by pasting it in the Settings window under Microsoft URL.
