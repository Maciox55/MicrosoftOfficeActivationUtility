# Microsoft Office 16/19 Activation Utility
A wrapper for the Microsoft Office OSPP utility purpose built for use at my job. Speeds up activation of stubborn Office 16/19 keys by using CID for activation (Alternate way of calling the Microsoft Activation Phone number). This utility is currently in development and changes often, use the Portable branch for most recent changes. Features are added as needed.

## Instructions
### Basic Usage

1.  Attempt activation of Office 16/19 using your key by changing the key first and activating second.
2.  If activation fails with a message of product key cannot be activated close the Office application and open the Utility.
3.  When the application starts you will see the current Installation ID and a list of different types of product keys on the right side. Check if the last 5 characters of the previously used key match any in the list.
4.  Check the settings and select the proper WebDriver from the drop down list or set up for the Remote/Portable Mode and Save.
5.  Click the GET CID button and wait for the application to automatically populate the Microsoft website and return the CID.
6.  The Large Activate button is now active and should be clicked, this will attempt activation.
7.  Open Office 16/19 application to verify if the product was activated.


This application uses legitimate and Microsoft provided resources which are publicly available. It does not attempt to disable. modify or circumvent Microsoft Activation processes to activate products. A legitimate key needs to be owned in order to use this utility.
